project about turtle modules and modules in python
Baically i have been reading a lot of manuals online about python and what i can make out of it so this is my first commit as an undergraduate computer science student in my first year at university. I wouldn't say it is too perfect since i need to improve in a lot but what matters is the spirit and desire to do what you love. So please don't judge if you see any errors probably next time i will have something better. Thank you for visiting my respitory
